    "## Generation of main graph dictionary and various specific data frames \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the main notebook for generating the graphs and metrics from the raw connectome files, it produces \n",
    "and saves (pickles) ' graph_dict ' which includes a dictionary for each subject (run) which contains the data itself, the graph generated from networkx, various global metrics and dictionaries of various node based measures. The intent is to use this graph dicionary as the main data source of analysis - other data frames and dictionaries are then to be created from this. This should involve as many computationally expensive steps as possible to avoid them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally I will then convert into a proper script and break up into functions but right now I am focused on getting usable code for analysis on the smaller multi run data \n",
    "\n",
    "For now it is organised as follows - \n",
    "1) an introductory cell to import and set various lists and variables to point to strings that will be dictionary keys\n",
    "\n",
    "2) a main loop that creates and fills the graph dict with the various metrics (this isn't set in stone, more metrics wwill be added, some will be discarded\n",
    "\n",
    "3) a cell to re-structure the dictionary labels for node based measures to be more human readable, and less prone to mistakes when converting and working with data as a matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "4) cells to pickle and unpickle the main dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "5) a few cells to generate node feature data frames that are suitable to be saved as csv to be easier to call in analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "6) a couple of measures like degree hist and laplacian spectrum which I havent decided how to save and use yet\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the structure is in (Subject)(run) this can cause confusion and conflict - however it is currently the most flexible way (I can think of) to organise as I am still analysisng the effects of rerunning tractography, it should be fairly simple to adapt the code to either not include (run) or standadise one run - the former is likely to be how I handle it once we have decided on a way forward with consistent tractography.
